# CENTURION

At the moment, the project is frozen, and its repositories have been cleared so as not to occupy the computing power of the service.

## What will be the purpose and function of this project?

CENTURION is a custom not-published theme for OBSIDIAN app which is being splitted in two forms:

1) form of collective snippets— you can fast enable/disable entire theme as modules;
2) just default theme— whilest you wouldn't have access to enable other themes, you would access full experience of this theme.

This theme tries to imitate "wordly-officed" design of documents by justifying text by length, other little tweaks and maybe even some bugs and bruteforces — imagine this theme as attempt to make your files look like you are a screenwriter.
